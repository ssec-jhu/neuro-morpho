Welcome to neuro_morpho's documentation!
==========================================

**neuro_morpho** is a Python library for training and evaluating UNet-based
models for the skeletonization of neurons in 2D images.

This project is designed to facilitate the training of models for segmenting
images of neural dendrites. It provides a flexible framework for training
and evaluating models, with support for various data augmentation techniques,
loss functions, and logging backends.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
